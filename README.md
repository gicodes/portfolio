# my-portfolio

- is a react application detailing about me, my resume, experience and previous projects.
- This project was built on ReactJS with npm ^18, react-fonts, Bulma CSS and Material-UI.


## Render Structure
  
- The absolute responsiveness of this app's UI depends on how the components are rendered.
- Applying 'create-react-app' default, App.js is rendered inside the *index.js* file like so;

  *import App from './App' ;*

  *ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
    .render(
      <React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>
      ) ;*
    
- However, App.js renders the application components dynamically with material's MediaQuery.
- The viewports are defined by two major material breakpoints; 
- i. *MobileApp* | mobile and ii. *DesktApp* | larger viewports.


## Component Structure

  The main components of this application can be found under the *src* directory like so;
